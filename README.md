# Rubix
Model of a Rubik's cube because science. Maybe someday there'll be a solver as well, but for now, trying to answer the following questions:
1. Can I do it?
2. Can I generalize the code to create any size based on single size parameter?
3. Given a sequence of n moves, if the sequence is repeated indefinitely starting from the home position, how long will it take to return to the home position? In other words, how long is the home to home cycle for a sequence of n moves?
